## Technology Stack
### Programming Language: Java
Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and portability. Java applications are executed on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), allowing for "write once, run anywhere" functionality. Additionally, Java's garbage collection mechanism minimizes memory management concerns such as leaks and overflow.
### Frontend Frameworks
#### uni-app
uni-app is a versatile framework built on Vue.js, enabling developers to write a single codebase that can be deployed across platforms, including Android, Web (responsive), and various mini-program ecosystems (WeChat, Alipay, Baidu, etc.). Its rich component library, support for Vue.js syntax, and two-way data binding make it a powerful alternative to native mini-program development.
#### Vue.js
Vue.js is a progressive framework for building user interfaces based on the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. It combines the best features of AngularJS and React, offering a component-based structure and efficient two-way data binding. The MVVM model ensures seamless communication between the backend data (Model), the user interface (View), and the bridge connecting them (ViewModel).
### Backend Framework: Spring Boot
Spring Boot simplifies the development of Spring-based applications by providing pre-configured setups and centralized configuration management. It allows developers to focus on coding business logic without extensive configuration overhead. Custom configurations can be easily managed, while default settings handle common requirements effectively, streamlining the development process.
